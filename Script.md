## Plot

George woke to the sound of traffic, the sky was gray.
After his typical breakfast of toast and an egg he left for school.
Normally George would have walked down Bleaker street, but today there was construction and he decided to take Flanders behind the zoo.

Being on time was not one of George’s specialities today would prove to be no different.
As he moved slowly.
As he walked behind the zoo he could see the trees and thick foliage growing above the heavy stone wall that ran behind the zoo; and hear the sounds of animals in the distance.
George had heard the sound before, but today there was a new sound, sort of a cross between an angelic horn and an elephant’s trumpet.
He stopped to listen and noticed a heavy wooden door in the zoo wall was ajar.

Normally George would leave well enough alone, but he was worried that an animal might escape.
He stuck his head in the door, the color of the foliage was intense greens, browns and chartreuse, he called out for a zoo keeper but got no response.
The smell of the the zoo was intense and alive.
He took a tentative step through the door and followed the stone path overgrown with giant ferns.

Along the stone path, he found the Zookeeper and they had a cool conversation.

At the end of the path, George and the Zookeeper, Braus, found a crystal door that seemed to be sealed
shut. However, there was a slot that seemed to fit a key, so George and Braus decided to look for the
key. After hours of searching with no avail, they found the key. It was actually right next to the
door the entire time, but was hidden until the light from the twilight illuminated it. George and Braus
used the key to unlock the door.

George and Braus then met the Unicorn King who granted them magic powers.
The end.
